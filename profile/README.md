# Our Projects

## UNILITY
A short description is as follows: 
<br><br>
University students face the common challenge of navigating various sources of information on a daily basis. This project aims to address this issue by providing a centralized platform that consolidates all relevant information in one place. The app includes a cafeteria menu with multiple date filtering options, transportation schedules, an interactive campus map, and a list of events and activities with information regarding the time, place, and a short description. In addition, it offers a means for students to access announcements made by the university administration. This effort is intended to enhance the student experience at universities by facilitating access to information and promoting unity among all students.
